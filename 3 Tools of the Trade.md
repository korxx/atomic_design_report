<h1>Tools of the Trade</h1>
<h2>Pattern Lab</h2>
<p>Takes source code - namely patterns - and compiles those patterns into a functional front-end UI inside a pattern library shell.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Static site generator tool for building atomic design systems.</li>
  <li>A pattern documentation and annotation tool.</li>
  <li>A pattern starter kit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pattern Lab doesn't give you any answers as to how to design or architect your front-end code, you have to do all that work yourself.</p>
<ul>Pattern Lab provides several helpful features for teams to create deliberate, thoughtful design systems. When choosing tools to create your pattern library, you should keep your eyes open for these qualities and features of effective pattern libraries:
  <li>Providing pattern descriptions and annotations.</li>
  <li>Showcasing the relevant pattern HTML, templating, CSS, and/or Javascript code.</li>
  <li>Viewing patterns across the entire resolution spectrum.</li>
  <li>The ability to showcase pattern variations, such as active or disabled tabs.</li>
  <li>The ability to dynamically add real representative content into the patterns' structures.</li>
  <li>Providing contextual information, like which patterns make up a particular component, as well as where that component is used.</li>
</ul>
