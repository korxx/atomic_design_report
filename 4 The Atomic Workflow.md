<h1>The Atomic Workflow</h1>
<p>It all comes down to people truly collaborating and communicating with one another.</p>
<br>
<p>When to create an interface design system?</p>
<p>Design systems and their accompanying pattern libraries are often created in conjunction with a new design or redesign project, replatforming effort, or other initiative.</p>
<h2>Interface Inventory</h2>
<p>An interface inventory is a comprehensive collection of the bits and pieces that make up your user interface.</p>
<h3>Conduction an interface audit</h3>
<p>Screenshots. Simply put, creating an interface inventory requires screenshotting and loosely categorizing all the unique components that make up your user interfaces.</p>
<ul>Patterns to capture
   <li>Global elements: components like headers, footers, and other global elements that are shared acress the entire experience.</li>
  <li>Navigation: primary navigation, footer navigation, pagination, breadcrumbs, interactive component controls, and essentially anything that's used to navigate around a user interface.</li>
  <li>Image types: logos, hero images, avatars, thumbnails, backgrounds, and any other type of image pattern that shows up in the UI.</li>
  <li>Icons: icons are a special type of image worthy of their own category. Capture magnifying glasses, social icons, arrows, hamburgers, spinners, favicons, and every other interface icon.</li>
  <li>Forms: inputs, text areas, select menus, checkboxes, switches, radio buttons, sliders, and other forms of user input.</li>
  <li>Buttons: primary, secondary, big, small, disabled, active, loading, and even buttons that look like text links.</li>
  <li>Headings: h1, h2... and all variations of typographic headings.</li>
  <li>Blocks: collections of typographic headings and/or images and/or summary text.</li>
  <li>Lists: unordered, ordered, definition, bulleted, numbered, lines, striped, or any group of elements presented in a list-type format.</li>
  <li>Interactive components: accordions, tabs, carousels, and other functional modules with moving parts.</li>
  <li>Media: video players, audiop players and other rich media elements.</li>
  <li>Third-party components: widgets, iframes, stock tickers, social buttons, invisible tracking scripts, and anything else that isn't hosted on your domain.</li>
  <li>Advertising: all ad formats and dimensions.</li>
  <li>Messageing: alerts success, errors, warnings, validation, loaders, popus, tooltips, and so on.</li>
  <li>Colors: capture all unique colores presented in the interface. [CSS Stats, Stylify Me]</li>
  <li>Animation: capture any UI element that moves, fades, shakes, transitions, or shimmies across the screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use a timer, spend 30 to 90 minutes doing this, don't lose yourself inside this.</p>
<p>Have a break, then have each participant spend five to ten minutes presenting each UI category to the group. Presenting to the group allows the team to discuss the rationale behind existing UI patterns. Decide a cohesive group of categories. All the hard work and discussion that went into the initial interface inventory exercise should be translated into the seeds of your future design system and pattern library.</p>
<ul><li>Which patterns should stay, which should go, and which can be merged together?</li>
  <li>What pattern names whould we settle on?</li>
  <li>What are the next steps to translate the interface inventory into a living pattern library?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Benefits of an interface inventory</h3>
<ul><li>Captures all patterns and their inconsistencies</li>
  <li>Establishes a scope of work</li>
  <li>Lays the groundwork to a sound interface design system</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>By taking the time to organize the parts, you can now create the whole in a more realistic, deliberate, and efficient manner.</strong></p>
