<h1>Atomic Design Methodology</h1>
<p>Atomic elements combine together to form molecules. These molecules can combine further to form relatively complex organisms. </p>
<ol><p>Atomic Design is a methodology composed of five distinct stages working together to create interface design systems in a more deliberate and hierarchical manner. This is not a linear process, but rather a mental model to help us think of our users interfaces as both a cohesive whole and a collection of parts at the same time.</p>
  <li>Atoms
    <ul>
      <li>Basic HTML elements.</li>
      <li>Can't be broken down any further and serve as the elemental building blocks of an interface.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Molecules
    <ul>
      <li>Relatively simple groups of UI elements functioning together as a unit.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Organisms
    <ul>
      <li>Relatively complex UI components composed of groups of molecules and/or atoms and/or other organisms.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Templates
  <ul><li>Page-level objects that place components into a layout and articulate the design's underlying content structure.</li>
    <li>You can create good experiences without knowing the content. What you can't do is create good experiences without knowing your content structure. What is your content made from, not what your content is.</li>
    <li>By defining a page's skeleton we're able to create a system that can account for a variety of dynamic content, all while providing needed guardrails for the types of contentt that populate certain design patterns.</ul>
  </li>
  <li>Page</li>
  <ul><li>Specific instances of templates that show what a UI looks like with real representative content in place.</li></ul>
</ol>

<h2>Advantages of atomic design</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The ability to quickly shift between abstract and concrete.</li>
  <li>Implied hierarchy</li>
  <li>Atomic design applies to all user interfaces, not just web-based ones.</li>
</ul>
