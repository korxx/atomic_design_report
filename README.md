Notes on Atomic Design by Brad Frost

<h1>Design Systems</h1>
<p>The cornerstone of good design systems are style guides, which document and organize design materials while providing guidelines, usage, and guardrails.</p>

<h2>Brand Identity</h2>
<p>Brand identity guidelines define the assets and materials that make a company unique.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Logos</li>
  <li>Typography</li>
  <li>Color palettes</li>
  <li>Messaging
    <ol>
      <li>Mission statements</li>
      <li>Taglines</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Collateral
    <ol>
      <li>Business Card</li>
      <li>PowerPoint template</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>etc..</li>
</ol>

<h2>Design Language</h2>
<p>Design languages style guides articulate a general design direction, philosophy, and approach to specific projects or products.They usually incorporate aspects of other style guides categories in order to make high-level concepts a bit more tangible. Those guidelines are not set in stone the way brand guidelines are. </p>
<p>Example: Material UI - Google</p>

<h2>Voice and Tone</h2>
<p>When a brand must communicate across so many varied touchpoints, speaking in unified, consistent manner becomes critical to a brand's success.</p>
<p>A brand's voice stays the same from day to day, but its tone has to change all the time, depending on both the situation and the reader's feelings.</p>

<h2>Writing</h2>
<p>Writing style guides provide every author some guidelines and guardrails for contributing content. These style guides can be extremely granular, defining particulars around punctuation and grammar, but they don't always have to be so detailed.</p>

<h2>Code</h2>
<p>I'ts essencial for teams to write legible, scalable, maintainable code. But wihtout a way to promote and enforce code consistency, it's easy for things to fall apart and leave every developer to fend for themselves.</p>
<p>Code style guides provide conventions, patterns and examples for how teams should approach their code. These guidelines and guardrails help rein in the madness so that teams can focus on producing great work together rather than refactoring a bunch of sloppy, inconsistent code.</p>

<h2>Pattern Libraries</h2>
<p>Front-end style guides, UI libraries, component libraries...</p>
<p>The rest of the book focuses on how to approach interface design in a systematic manner, and details how to establish and maintain pattern libraries.</p>
<h3>Style Guides</h3>
<p>Style guides are important tools that help prevent chaos, both from a design and development standpoint and also from an organizational perpective.</p>
<ul>Benefits of style guides
  <li>Consistency and Cohesion
  <ul><li>Making style guides central to your process results in user interfaces that feel more united and trustworthy, which helps users accomplish their tasks faster and empowers them to master the interface.</li></ul></li>
  <li>Shared vocabulary
    <ul>
      <li>As the number of people working on a project increases, it becomes all too easy for communication breakdowns to occur.</li>
      <li>For true collaboration to occur, it's essential for teams to speak a common language.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Education
    <ul><li>Education is as important as documentation. A style guide can show clients that websites are systems rather than colletcions of pages.</li></ul>
  </li>
  <li>Empathetic workflow
    <ul><li>Designers and developers are forced to think about how their decision affect the broader design system</li>
    <li>It becomes harder to go rogue and easier to think of the greater good. By collecting all these considerations under one roof, the style guide becomes a hub for everyone involved in the project, which helps each discipline better understand the design system from many perspectives.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Testing</li>
  <li>Speed
    <ul><li>It's true that devising and interface design system and creatting a custom pattern library initially takes a lot of time, thought, and effort.</li>
    <li>But once the pattern library is established, subsequent design and development becomes much faster.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Increases value over time
    <ul><li>Lessons learned from analytics, user testing, A/B testing, and experience should be incorporated into the style guide, making it a powerful hub for truth, knowledge, and best practices.</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<ul>Challenges of style guides
  <li>Requires organizations to overcome the short-term mentality that all too ofter creeps its way into company culture.</li>
  <li>Style guides are time-consuming to create.
    <ul><li>The hard part is building the machine that builds the product.</li></ul>
  </li>
  <li>Pattern libraries are often treated as auxiliary projects.</li>
  <li>Maintenance and governance strategy is critical to style guides success.</li>
  <li>Style guides can be misunderstood as tools useful only to designers or developers.</li>
  <li>For style guides to be useful resources for everyone in an organization, they should clearly convey what they are and why they matter.</li>
  <li>Without providing context, designers and developers don't know how global a particular pattern is, and as a result wouldn't know which pages of their app would need to be revisited if changes were made.</li>
  <li>Lack of a clear methodology</li>
</ul>
